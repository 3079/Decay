# Decay

You can play the game [here](https://3079.itch.io/decay-3)

Decay is a fast paced game about figting hoardes of undead enemies. It was created by the team of 2 people in 4 days as practice before attending Ludum Dare 48 game jam. The theme we picked was Decay, so it was decided to make a game where the main character would have an aura around them that would decay their surroundings and base the gameplay around that. The main character can fight monsters from range using bow and arrows or in close quarters using their knife. The aura can be used to combat enemies more effectively - it slows down zombie grunts and disables flaming shiels of burning enemies.

The goal of the game is to destroy 3 pentagrams using the aura by standing in circle for long enough.

I was responsible for most of the technical aspects of the game, i.e. programming, animations, level building.  
All the art and music were made by my teammate [Chertkov](https://chertkov.itch.io/).

The game was made using Unity 2019
